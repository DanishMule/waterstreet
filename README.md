Waterstreet
===========

Waterstreet is the official starter theme for all projects at WaterstreetGM. It is an evolving fork of `Bones` from Eddie Machado. To read more about that, head on over to: http://themble.com/bones/. 

How Can I use it? 
-----------------

You can download Waterstreet as it is, fork it, submit issues or pull requests to me to me, etc. You can do whatever you like with it. 

This is a pretty new fork, so it looks a lot like `Bones` at the moment. It won't forever. 

Stay with us!
